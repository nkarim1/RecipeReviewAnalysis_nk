# Recipe Review Analysis 
## This is the DSC80 Final Project for UCSD
My name is Nafeesa Karim, and this project aims to analyze the relationship between the complexity of online recipes and thier ratings. Specifically, do recipes with a longer preperation time or more steps tend to have lower ratings? Can the ratings of a recipe be predicted by it's complexity?
